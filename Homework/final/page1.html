    <header> <h1> 1990s Hip-Hop Rivalry </h1> </header>

    <h1> What Was It? </h1>

    <p> The 1990s hip-hop rivalry was a feud between the west coast and east coast hip-hop artist and fans that lasted from 1991 to 1997. Tupac Shakur and Christopher Wallace (The Notorious B.I.G, Biggie) were icons for each side. </p>

<h1> What Happened? </h1>

<p> In the early days of the rivalry, the animosity started from jealous between artist on both coast due to competition between record labels and for media coverage. One of the first hints of a rivalry was in 1991 when rapper Tim Dog released a diss track called, “Fuck Compton”, in which he attacked and threaten the LA rap scene and its rappers. </p>

<p> The peak of the rap beef originated from a rivalry between Tupac and Biggie, who were friends before they were rivals. Tupac was represented by Death Row Records, which was owned by Dr. Dre and Suge Knight, while Biggie was represented by Bad Boy Entertainment, which was owned by Sean “Diddy” Combs. However, the separate record companies isn’t what sparked the rivalry. </p>

<p> On November 30, 1994 Tupac was shot five times in the lobby of Quad Recording Studios located in Times Square. He accused Biggie and Sean Combs, both who were at the studio at the time of the robbery, of setting him up. Shortly afterwards, Biggie released the song “Who Shot Ya”, but firmly denied his involvement in the shooting. </p>

<p> Tupac's response was halted by a nine months prison sentence he served because of sexual assault charges. While in jail producers Suge Knight visited him, and on August 3, 1995 Knight attended the Source Awards at Madison Square Garden, where he verbally insulted Sean Combs and told all artist to come to Death Row Records. </p>
